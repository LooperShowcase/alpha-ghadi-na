      <h1>As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I can provide information on some well-known potato varieties. However, it's important to note that new potato varieties may have been developed since then. Additionally, the availability of specific potato varieties can vary by region.

Oldest types of potatoes:

Lumper Potato: Historically, the Lumper potato gained significance during the Irish Potato Famine in the mid-19th century. Unfortunately, it was not a very diverse or disease-resistant variety, contributing to the severity of the famine.

Irish Cobbler: This is one of the older varieties, dating back to the late 1800s. It is a round, white-skinned potato with a firm texture.

Newest types of potatoes:

The development of new potato varieties is an ongoing process, and breeders are continually working to create potatoes with improved characteristics such as disease resistance, better taste, and adaptability to different growing conditions. As of my last update, I can't provide information on the very latest varieties. To find the newest types of potatoes, you may want to check with agricultural research institutions, seed companies, or agricultural publications for the most recent developments.

If you're interested in the latest potato varieties, consider looking up recent agricultural publications, seed catalogs, or contacting agricultural research institutions for updated information.</h1>
